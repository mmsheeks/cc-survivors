# Clovercraft Survivors

Survivors is a custom game mode based on Grain's Third Life series on YouTube. The mod introduces a life system that
creates a semi-hardcore game.

## Limited Player Lives

All players start the game with 5 lives. Each time the player dies, they lose one life. When a player loses their last life,
they are permanently dead in the world and will be put into spectator mode.

Player life is indicated by tab list name color. 
- Dark green names have four or more lives
- Light green names have three lives
- Yellow names have two lives
- Red names are on their last life

### Giving Lives

Players can give a life to another player once every 24 hours. Using the command `/givelife <player>` a player may transfer
one of their own lives to another player. Note that you cannot donate your last life, and players may not exceed their 
starting life total of 5.

### Stealing Lives

When players are close to death, they may kill another to steal back a life. Yellow life players may kill any **Dark Green**
player. Red life players may kill any other player. Green players may not steal lives.

### Checking Your Life Total

Players can use the `/lives` command to check how many lives they have left at any time.
